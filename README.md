factorie-nlp-scripts
====================

Bash scripts for training/testing Factorie NLP components.

Getting started
----------------

  1. Set your `FACTORIE_ROOT` environment variable:
  ```
    export FACTORIE_ROOT="/path/to/factorie/source"
  ```
  
  2. Get the Factorie classpath from Maven:
  ```
    ./get_classpath.sh
  ```

Now you should be able to run any of the up-to-date scripts.
